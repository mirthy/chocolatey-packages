    <summary>Consul is a tool for service discovery, monitoring and configuration.</summary>
    <description>Consul is a tool for service discovery and configuration. Consul is distributed, highly available, and extremely scalable.
Consul provides several key features:
* Service Discovery - Consul makes it simple for services to register themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface. External services such as SaaS providers can be registered as well.

* Health Checking - Health Checking enables Consul to quickly alert operators about any issues in a cluster. The integration with service discovery prevents routing traffic to unhealthy hosts and enables service level circuit breakers.

* Key/Value Storage - A flexible key/value store enables storing dynamic configuration, feature flagging, coordination, leader election and more. The simple HTTP API makes it easy to use anywhere.

* Multi-Datacenter - Consul is built to be datacenter aware, and can support any number of regions without complex configuration.

Can optionally use C:\consul for configuration
